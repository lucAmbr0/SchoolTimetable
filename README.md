# Introduction
> This project is in a very early stage, many updates coming soon.
* **School Timetable** aims to provide a **convenient way for students to access their weekly class schedules**. Users can select their class, choose a day of the week, and specify a time slot to view which subjects are scheduled and in which classroom.
* This **web-based** tool streamlines the process of **checking timetables**, making it easier for students to **plan** their **academic activities**.
* This web project offers a **user-friendly interface** for **efficient navigation** and quick access to essential information.

##  :beginner: About
School Timetable is a project started last year with my personal need to have an all-in-one tool where I can consult my school timetables and quickly find my subjects, my teachers, the classrooms in which I will have lessons and those of my classmates of other classes quickly and in a single step.
<br>
From this need I created an html/css/js page where all the timetables I needed were stored and could be quickly filtered by day, time and class.
<br>
Its limitation was that modifying the code was required in order to use it. This problem led me to start this new project, in which I intend to develop a **user-friendly web app** where **each user can enter their personal data** and have a complete and **personalized experience without having to touch up the code**.

## :zap: Usage
Once the page is open, the app can be used in **2 ways**:
* When you open the app, **information about your saved classes during the current time and day on your device is shown**
* By selecting a timetable adjustment function, **the user chooses to view the class information relating to a day and time chosen by him on a table.**
There will also be a **"settings" tab where you can configure the app with your data**, such as the name of the school, saved classes, weekly subjects and any notes.

###  :electric_plug: Installation
* This project is still at a very early stage. My intention is to conclude the work with a single html file that the user downloads and opens with his web browser, all ready as it is.
* However, it is **not necessary to download the file**, you can simply **connect to the GitHub pages link** of this project (located at the top right of the repository page). The app **data** (timetables, classes, configurations) **is saved in the browser's local storage**.

##  :wrench: Development
This project is in a very early stage, so many updates will be arriving during this time.

### :notebook: Pre-Requisites
There are no special prerequisites for this project other than the following:
* A **chromium browser** like Google Chrome, Brave, Edge, Opera... (Not optimised for Safari and Firefox, which may not be compatible with some CSS rules)
* An internet connection
* Compatibility with browser's local storage functionality

###  :file_folder: File Structure
I will try to keep the repository structure as clean as possible to make maintenance and community contributions clearer

 ### :cactus: Branches

1. **`stage`** is the development branch.

2. **`master`** is the production branch.

3. No other permanent branches should be created in the main repository, you can create feature branches but they should get merged with the master.

**Steps to work with feature branch**

1. To start working on a new feature, create a new branch prefixed with `feat` and followed by feature name. (ie. `feat-FEATURE-NAME`)
2. Once you are done with your changes, you can raise PR.
